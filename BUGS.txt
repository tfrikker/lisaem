Here's a list of some of the current known issues, there are likely many others. Please report them on
the LisaList2 forum, or github issues.


* Windows - unicode chars in paths to Profile disks fail to work properly so the hard drive won't be found. Stick to all ASCII paths.
  If this is not possible because your user name contains UTF8, etc. please store your disk images in something like C:\LisaDisks, etc.
  (an ASCII only path) this is not an issue for macos, I suspect this is some wxwidgets string conversion issue that will take a significant
  work around to switch between wxWidgets wxStrings to C strings when communicating with libdc42 open fn's.
2022.10.19 ^^^ this might be fixed now, but it's a big hack, not sure if it will work everywhere, or forever.

* TerminalWx code isn't complete - xmodem is missing, font picker/color picker is missing.
* serial port A is broken on Lisa Office System (causes a lockup on access to the port) so it's disabled by default, there's a build script option to force enable it anyway.
* UniPlus kernel v1.4 from pre-installed disk images works, new installs fail because sunix kernel v1.1 isn't yet supported.
  + If you have a preinstalled UniPlus, you can now image it with BLU, convert the image with blu-to-dc42 and it will work in LisaEm, however, fresh installs will not work.
* Xenix fails to fully boot though starts the kernel, it fails to fully come up to the login prompt.
* MacWorks XL 3.0 mostly Works, but requires booting from floppy, later versions do not boot.
* Various sound generation issues across several platforms, but works on 
  GTK if SDL is enabled, so turning on SDL for build wx scripts, though sometimes 
  I see alerts for not being able to open ALSA, you 
  will need to also install the pulseaudio/ALSA proxy package. see:
  https://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_sound.html
    "Currently this class is implemented on Windows and Unix and can use either Open Sound System (OSS) or Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) under the latter. Notice that OSS is not provided any more by most, and maybe even all, Linux systems in 2017 and osspd (OSS Proxy Daemon) package typically needs to be installed to make it work."
  not sure about newer sound managers on Linux yet.
  - this is being addressed by replacing wxSound with OpenAL

* Mouse tracking fails to work under high load throttle- noticed on GTK.
  On my system when using a debug compiled binary and throttle set to 100MHz,
  Lisa Office System does not recognize mouse movement except for clicks.
  Seems to be a wxWidgets related issues where mouse movements are treated
  as lower priority without clicks and are not sent. Lowering the CPU throttle
  to 48MHz fixes this, YMMV. The OnMouseMove method is no longer called by the
  event handler. (The speed limit may vary on your host machine as well.)
  The symptom appears to ignore mouse up events in LOS, and every click is
  a drag.

* UPX on macos 10.8, 10.9 generates executables that segfault, do not use.
  Added code to the bashbuild scripts to disable it on those, possibly affects
  other macos x versions, based on old memories, I remember it working on PPC32/64
  on macos 10.4, not sure about 10.5-10.7. This also affects command line tools
  such as lisafsh-tool.

* dc42-to-tar is mostly working, except for a few edge cases.

* Monitor OS 0.12.3 takes a long time to power off the virtual Lisa after S(ysMgr / Off is invoked
  roughly about 3 minutes after selecting the menu option to shut down.

* Closing the TerminalWx window causes a segfault crash, tried to override the destructor to change
  the behavior to minimize the window instead of destroying it, but not working correctly yet.
