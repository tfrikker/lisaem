This does not work, only use just incase I kick the bucket to debug

2022.12.18-12.24 - in hospital, very sick



2022.11.22 added LOS 2.0 HLE ProFile read/write block, but when HLE is turned
           on LOS 2.0 booting from ProFile resets to Boot ROM. (It times out
           in a procedure named FLUSHFIL(e?) and then reboots.)


...
           [ very sick, low energy, lots of pain ]
...


2022.10.30 - fixup ROM stitching for 341-017x named boot ROMs.

2022.10.28 - fixup reboot issues

2022.10.27 - bugfix: LOS 2.0 USA now able to install again

2022.10.19 - possible hacky fix for opening some UTF8 file path issues such
             as 'SysteÌ€me de Bureau 2.0F I.dc42' - tested to work on Linux
             so far

2022.10.06 - 2022.10.13 ER/Hospital stay

2022.10.06 - fixed files with CRLF endings in repo

           - added 0.25MHz and 0.5MHz throttle for --tracelog enabled builds
             this is useful because Wayland doesn't update the display
             otherwise and it's hard to isolate turning tracelog on/off at
             the right times using Right-Click. So the fix is to set 0.25MHz
             right before turning on tracelog.

2022.10.05 - debugging LOS 2.0 install issues writing to ProFile HD

2022.10.04 - added --no-sound and --no-openal options to build.sh

           - optimize strip_and_compress in bashbuild to its own job
             some display output issues on first and last line, but, 
             works otherwise. (lisa tools)

2022.06.20 - move wxSound to it's own .cpp via #include
           - openAL sound support start - samples apps working,
             now integrating w/LisaEm C++ code

2022.06.14 - updates to libdc42 to load whole image in RAM for private
             images - private allows r/w access but changes are discarded.

2022.06.03 - switching sound to OpenAL on platforms where it's available
             (trying to avoid OpenAL-libalure as it doesn't build on 10.5
             with macports properly.)

             (Xenix doesn't fully boot yet, this is for the future)

2022.03.03 - TerminalWx Window for LPW via SOROC->VT100 translation

2022.02.28 - Hide TerminalWx windows instead of close to avoid segfault
           - Quit LisaEm when main LisaEm window is closed to avoid segfault

2022.02.22 - TerminalWx window for UniPlus

2022.01.15 - Multiple TerminalWx fixups + feature adds

2021.12.23 - fixed copy + Edit: Select all in TerminalWx code

2021.11.01 - profile.c cleanup/debugging

2021.10.30 - added package creation for OpenBSD 7 - end of Packagetober
             but it doesn't quite work correctly yet, so disabled for now

2021.10.24 - added FreeBSD 13 port for lisaem-1.2.7

2021.10.23 - added classic Solaris package creation for OpenIndiana, i.e.:
             pkg_add -i . SUNDERNETlisaem.1.2.7.OI_2021.04.x86-64.pkg

           - added IPS Solaris package creation for OpenIndiana

2021.09.10 - fixed crash on macos 11.x - wxDisplay constructor parent param
           - added _MACOSVER C define to help select wxDisplay parent params

           - non-production macos beta/RC releases will be renamed in the dmg 
             with the version info, releases will remain named LisaEm.app

           - Added --clean-preferences to macos x lisaem.sh to clear
             saved preferences incase LisaEm is misbehaving.

           - Added package option to windows build (implies install), makes a
             zip file which you'll extract in C:\Program Files - this is not
             a real installer yet, sorry.

2021.09.08 - added --list option to lisaem.sh to show available binaries for
             macos obese binaries.

2021.09.06 - added back lost --diet option to macos lisaem.sh option to remove
             unusable obese/universal binaries on your specific system.

           - modifications to allow cross platform build from x86_64 to M1 arm

2021.09.03 - fix macos missing ptsname_r (only exists in linux)

           - unstable push

2021.08.24 - added "Select existing ProFile" option when ProFile hard disk
             file path does not exist.

2021.08.20 - trying to find why booting is broken again

2021.08.02 - fixes to TerminalWx to allow Windows to compile

2021.08.01 - fixed windows compile issues around strcasestr, lstat, z8530-pty

           - incorporating PR changes from pull #7 from @Neelix57 via github

2021.07.12 - fixes to decode-vsrom tool for output + various formats such as
             matching service mode and BLU displays

2021.06.26 - attempting a new HLE intercept for UniPlus sunix v1.1 kernel
             not yet working

2021.06.19 - added decode-vsrom tool 

2021.06.09 - Issue with floppy emulation caused wrong interrupt service routine
             vector execution since it happened inside an opcode before the
             PC got updated with the size of the opcode. Detected in UniPlus
             kernel v1.1 sunix installer

2021.06.06 - got UniPlus v1.4 kernel booting up (used a pre-installed UniPlus
             BLU image from widget converted to dc42)

2021.05.12 - added some new dc42/*raw conversion tools and added -i,-d,-s
             options to existing disk tools to turn de/interleave on/off.
             raw-to-dc42 -d aphid.image   for example can allow you to
             move a Cameo/Aphid image to LisaEm, likely
             dc42-to-raw -i lisaem-profile.dc42 should copy a LisaEm
             image to Cameo/Aphid.

2021.05.07 - added some 6504 code for MW+II, but it hangs before it does
             the PFG detection, also display has some junk

2021.05.02 - still trying to get UniPlus to work with the emulated ProFile

2021.04.30 - more work on 4MB MacWorks, but need to find the right MacWorks
             version and setup for MMU

2021.04.13 - Added LOS 3.1 HLE block read code

2021.04.12 - finished bisecting out the introduced profile bugs that were
             preventing LOS from booting up. Meh.

2021.04.04 - fixed another reboot bug

           - fixed more ProFile state synchronization issues

           - diffing code between working and non-working profile code
             in profile.c irq.c reg68k.c hle.c rom.c romless.c to bisect
             issue breaking LOS profile access

2021.03.30 - modified interrupts to push cpu stop clock by a few thousand 
             cycles in the future when IRQ Mask prevents interrupt. Also stopped
             checking IRQs lower than the mask. Otherwise timer code got
             executed for every cycle needlessly slowing down emulation.

           - more fixes to ProFile code (now LOS hangs around state 6)
             sometime after 3/24, broke LOS profile emulation in my
             attempts to get uniplus booting.

           - HLE ProFile code for the ROM works well, as does ROM loading
             sectors for LOS in the boot loader, but not after LOS kernel
             loads.

2021.03.21 - reformatted this file + fixed some spelling errors
           
           - more work on IRQ firing mechanisms to fix BSY/CA1 issues

2021.03.20 - added UniPlus deserialize command + patch in LisaEm
             was able to get a BLU image of a UniPlus Widget that was
             serialized to start up, but not boot all the way yet.

           - oops, missed setting triggering IRQs for when CA1 is flipped on
             VIAs. This broke profile signaling for UniPlus

2021.03.19 - working on patching UniPlus sunix v1.1 installation kernel
   to
2021.03.15
           - fixed a floppy controller bug

           - added checkbox to report back double sided Sony 800 floppies

           - now COPS reset only sends Lisa Keyboard ID to Boot ROM
             to prevent messing up UniPlus's display reporting of
             the keyboard id to match what physical Lisas do

2021.03.08 - added UniPlus High Level Emulation ProFile data xfer code

2021.03.07 - patching UniPlus handshaking so it gets past ASSERTION()s

2021.03.03 - added uniplus-set-profile-size tool that modifies the uniplus
             unix kernel to allow much larger ProFile compatible hard disks
             (i.e. on X/ProFile, IDE:File, Aphid/Cameo devices.)
             
2021.02.21 - UniPlus no longer crashes with double panic, starts up and
             now complains about the profile handshaking.
           - added timestamps, sizes, flags to lisafsh-tool dir command

2020.02.20 - fixed rom.c merging/stitching when 341-17[5|6]-?.bin is used

2020.02.19 - fixed some bugs with lisafsh-tool where not all directory blocks
             are listed, replaced it with a lot more detail including desktop
             names, sizes, dates, flags

2020.01.12 - adding capture, xmodem to TerminalWx for interfacing with BLU

2020.01.11 - TerminalWx functioning now

2020.01.09 - switched Preferences for serial ports to pull down menu as it
             now has too many items

2020.12.22 - added TerminalWx code as library to endpoint for serial ports

2020.12.09 - added host serial port support, either wired or USB adapter for
             linux, should work on macos and FreeBSD as well, but as of yet
             untested. The text parameter is the device name such as
             /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB0. When used by itself, the guest OS and
             its applications can set the port parameters such as baud rate,
             stop bits, and parity. In some applications it would be more
             useful to override this, for example by setting a high baud rate
             or hardware handshaking (which LisaTerminal does not support).
             To do this append a pipe character followed by the settings
             and options using commas as separators. i.e.:
             "/dev/ttyUSB0|38400,n,8,1,hw" additionally ,sw is allowed for
             xon/xoff software handshaking, or ,-sw or ,-hw is allowed to
             disable those. Host serial and shell are not available on
             windows yet. Future releases may add these features, possibly
             by using WinPTY.

2020.11.28 - more testing of Serial Port A

2020.11.27 - attempting to get Serial port A to not hang, under Lisa Office
             System, but didn't get any useful results, so disabling the 
             Serial A port for now.

2020.11.26 - more guard code around xon/xoff handling

           - rewrote SCC reconnect/disconnect code for ROM SCC tests vs LOS

           - SCC port B xon/xoff now works properly

2020.11.22 - found a bug in the EXITR macro and fixed it

           - using the new MMU code MacWorks XL starts up

           - verified + fixed high contrast turns display yellow in MonitorOS

2020.11.19 - rewrote 3 MMU ea code candidates + wrote testers

2020.11.08 - found a possible MMU bug where stack space is incorrect via
             debugging uniplus crashing

           - monitor OS was crashing on boot

           - MacWorks was crashing on boot
             
2020.11.06 - fixed Xenix pfcmd bad state: 0306 but Xenix still doesn't start

           - enabled illegal instructions to follow the ILLEGAL trap, this
             got UniPlus to get further along, but double panics on startup

2020.10.23 - more work on Xenix profile access

2020.10.22 - added dc42-to-tar to extract tar archives from multi-floppy xenix
             tar archives, but needs more work to complete

2020.10.24 - informix for xenix deserialization + tool

2020.10.17 - attempting to get Xenix to accept LisaEm profile emulation

2020.09.15 - debugging mouse clicks in LOS - behaves as if LOS is not
             receiving mouse up events, though they are being sent, making
             windows drag. Also it seems it only notices mouse movement
             on mouse down rather than all mouse move events.

           - even though pty code uses a 32K buffer for serial ports, we get
             cut off after about 30 or so chars, so ls -l on host via
             LisaTerm gets cut off. Need some way to limit number of times
             we send IRQ 6 to let LOS know that SCC has received data

2020.09.14 - debugging hangs caused by PTY

2020.09.12 - added PTY support, ran/fixed into a bug in fliflo queue

2020.09.06 - investigating a serial A issue that causes freezing issues in LOS

2020.08.28 - fixed crash on reboot caused by freeing lisaram

2020.08.23 - fixed lisaem.sh CPU name on PowerPC

           - fixed crash on ROMless boot when user selects ProFile but cancels
             ProFile creation.

           - fixed build.sh misplaced fi breaking windows installs

           - verified 10.5 PPC vs i386 machine.h match for crosscompiling

           - fixed bug: 10.5 i386 crosscompiling PPC did not set BIG_ENDIAN
             PPC builds

2020.08.20 - reworked display system refreshes, added checkbox to disable
             mouse scaling, added back refresh rate to status bar.

2020.08.03 - revert the pc24->pc32 changes as they caused an increase in RAM
             requirements by an additional 640MB when not in used to accomodate
             for the extra 256X increase in address space.

           - MacWorks is no longer crashing in Hard Disk Initialize on return
             to the Finder, however, it Sad Mac's out when trying to boot from
             the hard disk, so there are other issues there.

           - cleaning up the source code a bit to remove some dead code, and
             unneeded debugging scaffolding.
             
2020.08.02 - fixed bug, Desktop menu, scrollbars, and linker now work.

2020.07.28 - found the real bug, Aidx mode 6 i.e. MOVE.L (A0,D0,0),(A1,D1,0) 
             only worked for the source, D0 is used on both source and dest,
             and D1 is ignored.

2020.07.21 - found JMP strips off high byte of PC, I thought I fixed this,
             but there's more hiding.

2020.07.15 - raising the memory to 2MB-128k works, was 1.5M before
             other settings such as 2MB-32K or -64K will result in error 70
             2MB will cause memory issues as well, not sure why this is

2020.07.01 - running many CPU tests. Found issues with DIVU not clearing N flag,
             and the CHK opcode.

2020.06.26 - found an old IDEFileToDC42 that Natalia Portillo wrote, added it
             to the tools, sorry should have included it back in 2008 :(
           - working on supporting copies of X/Profile CF cards made with the
             unix dd command via a xprofile-to-dc42 tool.

2020.06.25 - updated blu-to-dc42 to better support Widgets, added a tool to
             copy the boot sector + boot loader from one hard drive to another.
             Sadly it doesn't allow for Widgets to boot in LisaEm, causes address
             10726 error.

2020.06.19 - found the bozo bit (DRM) flag for Lisa Tools. When enabled on a
             tool on a 400k floppy, LOS will serialize it on the first copy to
             the hard drive. Created tool to add the bozo bit and updated the
             deserialize to remove it as well. Office tools no longer required
             repeated deserialization when the disk is installed each time.

           - firing up my old NeXT slab to test some more 68000 opcodes as it
             would be useful to fix the LPW linker in order to help with the
             Apple Lisa LOS source code project that AEK has going.

2020.06.17 - blu-to-dc42 verified working for ProFile hard drives, *but not*
             for Widgets as their transfer over BLU is somewhat different.


2020.06.13 - fixed screenshots save dialog box file filter

           - enabled proper floppy insert sound when power is off (so no motor
             sound plays)

2020.06.06 - looking at https://github.com/tfrikker/lisa_utils.git by Tom 
             Frikker for fixes to my blu-to-dc42 code via an 68kmla thread
             https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&controller=topic&id=59686&do=findComment&comment=637973

2020.06.03 - more automation for building macos x releases

2020.06.02 - added libdc42 image tester as I suspect file corruption is being
             caused by something, but it's not libdc42.

2020.05.27 - fixed most of the ui display bugs on macos x
           - RC1 release

2020.05.19 - fixed some minor ui bugs on macos x

2020.05.12 - added region handling to hq35x-3x code for partial updates

2020.05.10 - more fixes to bashbuild - forced min NUMCPU to two to fix 
             handling inconsistencies

2020.04.24 - found the reason for the flashing rectangle, it's the VidRefresh
             method which calls wxFrame::Refresh - this is documented as having
             a boolean param which is supposed to NOT erase the background when
             called with false, but this motherfucker does so anyway, even on
             wx3.1.3! omgwtfbbw!
             https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0/classwx_window.html#a29dc7251746154c821b17841b9877830
             Even worse, the ::OnErase method it calls cannot suppress the
             erase event even when the event.Skip() and event.StopPropagation()
             are called! Only realized this because I had the wrong area being
             passed to VidRefresh, which is the cause of the flashing rects.

             But in the process broke skinned AntiAlias w/Gray Replacement
             when --rawbits is not used.


2020.04.01 - Infrastructure work: setting up macos VMs and retooling the
2020.04.11   build-wx3.1.2-modern-macosx.sh build script to be more flexible,
             compiling LisaEm for various macos versions.

2020.03.31 - display works better on macos x, though it breaks up a bit by one
             pixel. But have to use wxDoubleBufferedPaintDC instead of 
             wxPaintDC. Strangely enough wxAutoBufferedPaintDC does not work.
             Unfortunately this makes the display very slow. Grrrrrr.

2020.03.30 - more macos x debugging

2020.03.29 - fixes for AA/AAG flashing menu bar on updates again

2020.03.28 - added -D define passthrough option for build script

2020.03.27 - fixing debugging warnings/errors on macos x 10.12,
             adding fix for -lstdc++.6 vs -lstdc++

2020.03.25 - more bashbuild fixes, updates, enhancements

           - automating scripts for macos dmg

           - adding a macos binary launcher - instead of making a fat universal
             binary using lipo, a script replaces the lisaem binary which then
             detects the OS and CPU architecture, and tries to locate the 
             newest compatible binary for the current machine. This way we can
             have x86_64 bit binaries for macos 10.7, 10.10, 10.12, etc. and
             the most suited one for the current os will be launched.

2020.03.14 - more bashbuild fixes

           - power off hidpi reset to 1.0 bug fix

2020.03.12 - bashbuild fixes

2020.03.09 - work on blu-to-dc42, doesn't quite work with widgets yet
           - more macos x cleanup

2020.03.03 - added estimates to build scripts so progress bars are better
           - more os x cleanup

2020.02.29 - macos x: skin path fixes, missing icon issue, cleanup fixes

2020.02.25 - window resizing fixes

2020.02.22 - macos x mouse scale fixes

2020.02.21 - windows mouse location and other fixes

2020.02.18 - hqx now works on windows, though there's some flashing, and mouse
             location is off, even in 4k mode

           - fixed skinless mode centering

2020.02.17 - fixed GTK mouse location for all supported scaling modes

2020.02.16 - fixed skinless mouse coordinates for 50% 

           - fixed menu shortcuts

2020.02.12 - adding code to support libSDL2 because wxSound on all modern GTK
             is broken even when using osspd-pulseaudio/, why the wxDevs don't
             care to support pulseaudio natively is a great question! I might
             switch to openal eventually as well even though it's deprecated
             on future macos X.

2020.02.09 - added kiosk mode + skinless centered origin vs top-left command
             line options for raspberry pi Lisa case modes, this is equivalent
             to: `-F -s- -p -q --o-`
             CLI options are now:

             Usage: lisaem [-h] [-p] [-q] [-f <str>] [-d] [-F[-]] [-z <double>] 
                           [-s[-]] [-c <str>] [-k] [-o[-]]
               -h, --help            show this help message
               -p, --power           power on as soon as LisaEm is launched
               -q, --quit            quit after Lisa shuts down
               -f, --floppy=<str>    boot from which floppy image ROMless only
               -d, --drive           boot from motherboard ProFile/Widget ROMless only
               -F, --fullscreen      fullscreen mode (-F- to turn off fullscreen)
               -z, --zoom=<double>   set zoom level (0.50, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25,... 3.0)
               -s, --skin            turn on skin
               -c, --config=<str>    Open which lisaem config file
               -k, --kiosk           kiosk mode (suitable for RPi Lisa case)
               -o, --originctr       skinless mode: center video(-o) vs topleft(-o-)


           - ipct bug was in var.h INVALIDATE_IPC macro which didn't wipe mt->table
             after free_ipct().

2020.02.07 - found a bug where IPCT of the currently executing instruction is
             being freed incorrectly.

2020.02.06 - found an off by one in the init_initial_ipcts() which might be
             causing memory instability. Found a memory leak in 
             cpu68k_makeipclist.

2020.01.31 - Tom Stepleton reported a bug where the mouse keeps reporting even
             when not moving after the first move. Fixed.

2020.01.26 - looks like I didn't need to build all that hidpi_scale code as
             dc.SetUserScale() was available for the same, refactored to do
             it the right way. Fixed some minor new and old bugs.

2020.01.25 - found a workaround for the black screen, but it's slower.
             rewrote hq3x to actually do 2x3y, the result is beautiful, and
             it even converts the 50% gray patterns into actual gray.

2020.01.20 - noticed some memory clobbering in either LisaEm or libdc42, but
             have not found the section of code where it happens. Added 
             valgrind to build script, addressing output of valgrind, looks
             like I need to resize the wxBitmap I'm passing to hq3x.cpp

2020.01.14 - redoing hq3x code, various fixes to build scripts, not able to
             get proper hq3x display when using larger sizes, wx shows a black
             screen On_Paint even though both the source and target DC's pass
             IsOk.

2019.12.25 - fixed macosx build/install for bashbuild, progress bar is still
             way off

2019.12.24 - various fixes, centralized upx/strip to a bash fn, removed mono-
             lithic compiles, moved them QJOB/WAITQALL as per TODOs.
             lowercased old 1.3.0 build uppercase function names, more cleanup

2019.12.23 - Windows, fixed install, LisaEm can now find its skins and tries
             to start, but dies on power on if HQ3X mode is used. AAG mode
             works. There's also some flashes and some display artifacts,
             shutdown causes the emulator to quit, or more likely crash.
             Sound does not seem to work.

2019.12.16 - Windows compiles are starting to work though skins aren't found
             Can't use pre-compiled wxmsw binaries, added a Cygwin compile
             script to the scripts directory and changed Windows.sys and some
             of the other build scripts.

2019.12.15 - cleaning up source and switching git repos to:
             github.com/rayarachelian/lisaem
             Windows compiles but the resulting binaries are broken

2019.12.12 - Rebuilt Windows build steps via Cygwin for new bashbuild system
             a lisaem.exe is produced, however the resulting binary is somehow
             not linked statically, and when the wxmsw dlls are provided, it
             fails to start.

2019.12.07 - rewrote a lot of the 1.3.0 build scripts and separated the fn's
             out to their own include files, standardized the build scripts
             to the new "buildbash" way of doing things, added progress bar
             and image display for KiTTY (will do for iTerm2 as well),
             sub-build scripts are now source'd instead of executed 
             separately for better performance.

           - started work on adding pty support for the serial ports

2019.11.19 - Completed move to build system from LisaEm 1.3.0 and cleaned up
             scripts. Full prod build now takes 25s vs 50s as it runs in
             parallel on my i7-7700HQ laptop which has 4 cores enabled. Will
             add better OS detection support as well as pkg building support.
             The directory structure matches that of 1.3.0 and is somewhat
             reminiscent of the layout of a physical Lisa, something I 
             intended in the very early versions of LisaEm back in 1998 but
             threw out due to various pivots.

2019.11.16 - fixed a minor Mojave/Catalina library issue

           - looking into adding support for real serial ports and tty/pty
             ports on Linux/*bsd systems.

2019.11.12 - started moving to build system scripts originally used for
             v1.3.0 to take advantage of multiprocessor builds and other
             enhancements since I have to rewrite portions of the build
             system for Windows anyway.

2019.11.11 - fixed some more IPCT issues caused by lack of initialization,
             added some debug guard routines to catch more if they happen.
             2nd Alpha release for macos

2019.11.09 - issue with multiple IPCT free caused by LOS doing memory writes,
             this added the same IPCT to the free list, which then was reused
             causing crashes. Added ipct->used flag to prevent this.
             
2019.11.07 - reverted cops.c and profile.c due to widget code preventing disk
             from working; mouse issues caused by warning removal introducing
             bugs.

2019.11.06 - fixed some screenshot bugs around hq3x

           - fixed pause checkbox menu item incorrectly showing paused
           
2019.11.05 - fixed a bunch of crashy bugs around skinless modes 

           - mouse location is still incorrect

2019.11.04 - fixed 2Y mode rendering issues

2019.11.03 - got rid of the extraneous clipboard wspaste_clipboard stuff

           - increased clipboard paste from 8k to 32K, don't think there's
             much need for larger pastes in terms of being able to paste
             code into LPW Edit, but maybe will allow larger pastes with a 
             progress bar dialog that has a stop button in the future.

2019.10.31 - Drag and Drop starting to work.

2018.10.27 - work on Drag and Drop files - allows dropping a floppy on top
             of the emulator, or a text file (which will be typed into the
             virtual keyboard the same as clipboard text pastes.)

           - HQX upscaler works nicely now
             
2019.10.15 - 2019.10.27 more HQX upscaler work, much nicer than the other
             modes including AAG

2019.10.13 - got it working on macos X with some work, had to compile wxWidgets
             and LisaEm with -stdlib=libc++, and LisaEm with -lstdc++.6 to get
             it working. There's still quite a lot of bugs left to fix but it's
             starting to work again on modern macos X, but at least both can
             be built with clang rather than gcc7, but at least now it builds
             and doesn't segfault immediately on startup.

2019.10.08 - hqx3.5 renderer work cont'd

           - clang compiled Lisaem on x86_64 macosx segfaults at unknown
             location while initializing data from config files, couldn't find
             it yet via llldb, will try again, possibly switching to gcc and
             gdb via brew.sh

2019.10.07 - build successful on x86_64 macosx10.9.5 in 64 bits

2019.10.06 - build successful on ppc32 macosx10.5.8

2019.10.05 - added a skin selector dialog box

2019.10.01 - encountered stdc++11 issues on OSX with clang/llvm and wxWidgets
             as well as a different set of warnings and errors that I didn't
             see on g++/gcc 7.4, cleaned up most of them so it can compile on
             macOSX 10.9.5

2019.09.28 - fixed to 2x3y video mode

2019.09.25 - cleaning up source code and formatting
           - hunting down a power button issue that pauses the Lisa instead of
             powering it off.

2019.09.24 - Noticed weirdness between wx3.1.2 and earlier, wx3.1.2 rescales
             4k to 1080p automatically, and handles radio button menus 
             differently which will cause incompatibility issues.

2019.09.15 - got rid of most of the compilation warnings from most of the
             code

2019.09.07 - the display in my laptop died, so switched to a chromebook 
             running GalliumOS for development

2019.09.03 - added command line switch for zoom, i.e. -z1.50
           - changed fullscreen command line parameter to negateable:
             i.e. -F  or --fullscreen  enables fullscreen, 
                  -F- or --fullscreen- disables fullscreen

2019.08.19 - fixed a bunch of warnings
to   08.27 - moved skin settings to their own class

2019.08.06 - fixed some dumb bugs, time to refactor and clean up a bit more

2019.08.01 - Changed checkbox menu items to radio (*) where appropriate

2019.07.31 - fixed up more HiDPI issues

2019.07.30 - fixed up bunches of HiDPI induced display issues, but more to go
           - fixed a bug with sound playback

2019.07.02 - switch sound playback to RAM wave creation instead of /tmp

           - cleaned up reg68k_external_execute by moving debug code out
             to its own function

           - fixed a bunch of GUI bugs, not saving screen size, etc.
2019.06.06 - fixing GUI bugs - meh

2019.06.01 - fixed MMU bug caused by mmu_trans array not being auto-zero filled

2019.05.30 - removing some of the unused insetjumpland code/if statements

             { break; /* - too busy with work, LisaList2, etc. */ }

2018.11.28 - added region grab in debug mode

           - removed File -> Run menu item to remove confusion between pause
             and run. User should use Key Power-On or click on power button

2018.11.23 - added mime64 encoder/decoder - has some minor termination bugs
             yes, I know wxWidgets has one, but I have other plans for this.

2018.10.15 - added screen rectangle grab in debug mode, output will be
             mime64 encoded.

2018.06.21 - more widget RE work; looking at Lisa's serial # as written to
             the MDDF, which is different than what's @240.  Added a
             better serial number decode function to floppy.c, but likely
             should move it elsewhere like glue.c or for 1.3 in the cpu
             board.

2018.05.24 - hq3x porting to LisaEm, widget protocol reverse engineering
             while the Widget ERS has much info, it doesn't have detail
             that I'd need a real widget and a protocol analyzer to get at.

2018.05.22 - control-q/q/Q will quit when not running an OS

           - Added command line options.
             -p, --power       	power on as soon as LisaEm is launched
             -f, --floppy=<str>	boot from which floppy image
             -d, --drive       	boot from motherboard ProFile/Widget
             -F, --fullscreen  	start in fullscreen mode
             -s, --skin        	turn on skin
             -S- --skin--      	turn off skin
             -c, --config=<str>	Open which lisaem config file

             { break - too busy with work }

2018.04.13 - Adding Widget support after discussions with Tom Stepleton and
             James MacPhail.  Turns out Widgets are quite a bit different
             from ProFiles!  See Widget_ERS.pdf on bitsavers for details.
             (While widgets can pretend to be a profile, they use a totally
             different protocol in native mode to xfer multiple blocks. Disks
             like the HD20, pippin, and Nisha have similar but also
             incompatible protocols, yeay, standards!) Many thanks to Tom
             Stepleton and Dr. Patrick SchÃ¤fer for providing Widget traces
             and dumps and sanity checking.

2018.04.04 - New feature, adding hq3x filter to improve display scaling on
             HiDPI displays, and also fixing Lisa's regtangular pixels.

2018.04.01 - seems LOS/LPW set the high byte of PC to the A-Line trap address
             and this doesn't seem to be an error.  Allowing bits 31-24 in PC
             to be set doesn't affect the execution of LOS/LPW at all. Infact
             it uses the A-Trap as an address to where it should jump to...
             [I swear this is not an April Fool's joke, though it should be!]

           - ipc cache invalidations now work across MMU contexts, i.e.
             supervisor mode (cx1) can load code into cx4, will now invalidate
             memory caches in both cx1 and cx4.

           - fixed a hidden ipc memory leak not caught by valgrind

2018.03.28 - paste would send LF as LF on Linux, replaced LF as a copy of CR
             so can paste code into LPW Editor now

2018.03.22 - added F-line wormholes to help track down bugs

           - cleaned cpu68k.c ipc, memory.c RAM code to make it more readable
             and more like the original using a few C macros.

2018.03.21 - fixed bad region refresh in AAG blit

2018.03.18 - wipe/free CPU IPCTs and memory on reboot

2018.03.14 - buserror bug manifests in LisaTest (2 disk version) as well

           - Fixed messagebox/yesnodialog from C (was showing blank dialog)

           - Stephen Hawking has left our universe, ever the joker, he 
             picked Pi day :(

2018.03.04 - Tom Stepleton discovered LisaMandlebrot zoom doesn't work in
             LisaEm, he wrote up a set up apps that do division and tripped
             the CPU bug that causes a weird bus error.  Getting closer on
             squashing this bug.

2018.03.04 - Collapsed Skins On/Off menu item into a single item
           - converted display scale and refresh menu items to submenus

2018.03.01 - added _H()/_N() array lookups for hidpi_scale acceleration

2018.02.28 - Parameterized skins so new ones can be made, but needs more work
           - Added skin debug #ifdefs to color display, floppy, power switch

2018.02.25 - added fullscreen display option, not sure about elsewhere, but
             on wxGTK menu is hidden and cannot be turned on/off without having
             to exit full screen and re-enter it which causes some nasty
             animation.  This is a bug in wxWidgets 3.1.x :(

2018.02.24 - v1.2.7 work started - added hidpi_scaling

2018.02.20 - fixed 2x3y and 2y video modes

2018.02.02 - Gilles discovered that writes to unused I/O space does not cause
             a bus error (via GemDOS), added this to LisaEm.  Thank you!

2017.11.xx - My 2011 Macbook pro 17" died with GPU failure, making switch to linux.
             Goodbye Apple. I miss Apple Computer, Inc. and user upgradeable
             products. Soldered in RAM, SSD, glued in batteries, walled gardens,
             stores, locked down operating systems, and other planned
             obsolescence anti-features are a deal breaker for me.

2016.02.16 - wxString patches from Zoltan Balaton, many thanks. :)


--- 1.2.6.2  Released on 2015.09.03  linux/raspbian fixes

--- 1.2.6.1  Released on 2015.08.29  linux/raspbian fixes

--- 1.2.6    Released on 2015.12.13 (Major release for all platforms)


2007.12.03 - fixed win32 rawbitmap issues, this should speed up the display
             quite a bit.  Linux rawbitmaps don't work yet, just show a blank
             white display.

2007.12.01 - fixed bugs on skinless on OS X.  Issue with wxBitmap, it needed
             to be filled in before using.  Some update to wxWidgets changed
             the default from the default being white, to an alpha background
             causing the whole display to fail to update at all since the
             data inside the wxBitmap was invisible.

           - bug report - libexpat was accidentally turned on in the OS X 
             version of LisaEm, this is not needed by LisaEm's use of 
             wxWidgets, it will be removed via  --without-expat in 
             wxWidgets' configure script.


--- 1.2.5    Released on 2007.11.25


2007.11.22 - imagewriter - fixed page size - at least for LisaWrite 

2007.11.21 - imagewriter lowercase letter "t" was broken

           - imagewriter page size tweaking

2007.11.18 - found way to make graphics smoother, added menu options to 
             throttle menu to define balance between animation and CPU time.


--- 1.2.2    Released on 2007.11.11


2007.11.08 - fixed slot preferences - browse buttons between high/low ports
             were swapped.

           - fixed parallel port u/l assignments - opposite from what LOS uses

             switch to Profile.

2007.09.15 - debugging ROMless boot.
             new bug: when trying to boot from floppy, if a profile exists

             garbage on save of preferences.

           - corrected a bug preventing the grabbing of the host time and
             date.  Found that MacWorks locks up when date is invalid.

2007.07.04 - LisaEm documentation completion

2007.07.03 - Testing various opcodes to locate scroll bar arrow bug in LOS
             not found, but eliminated shift/rotate opcodes.

---          RC2 


2007.06.26 - fixes to build.sh for differences between platforms.

2007.06.22 - floppy de-serialization routines.

2007.06.20 - rawbmp.h code finally works - except crashes on win32. :-(

2007.06.13 - rawbmp.h code works, much, much faster!

2007.06.12 - wxImage::SetRGB works - faster than old blit code

2007.05.01 - integrating new wxui code is taking me too long becaue of a lack
             of free time, so I'm going to go the other way so as to be able
             to make a release soon.

2007.04.24 - Dual Parallel ROM cheat

2007.04.15 - Found OS X display slowdown issues
	
           - Fixed display sizing issues when skinless.

2007.04.14 - Fixed skins on/off switch on OS X

2007.04.13 - Debugging video system on OS X

2007.04.11 - Added Disk Copy 6.x detection to libdc42 open.  This allows
             better error messages to be returned.

2007.04.10 - Added MacBinII stripper to libdc42 auto_open

2007.04.09 - finalized buffered raw keycodes to compensate for repeats

           - decoupled the COPS 1/10th second timer from Lisa CPU and tied
             it to the host clock, clock is now accurate regardless of CPU
             speed.

2007.04.08 - added Unthrottled menu option for those who want to melt their
             host computer. :-)

           - added buffered raw keycodes to compensate for repeats.

2007.04.07 - bug with raw keycodes that prevents updates found and fixed.

2007.04.06 - Changes for OS X issues (might roll these back since Jerome
             Vernet found that the slowdown issues go away with wxWidgets
             2.7.2, will test on all platforms before committing to either
             path.)

           - reworked display to draw directly to dc and skip full blit
             only done for AntiAlias mode, need to redo for all others.

           - reworked timing loop to no longer need wxMilliSleep


--- RC 1     Released on 2007.04.04 


2007.04.04 - fixes to initial video position on skinless mode.

           - added 8Hz display refresh rate for slow hosts.

           - on shutdown throttle is removed + display refresh forced to 8Hz
             to compensate for ~Imagewriter slowdowns.

2007.04.02 - changes to build.sh to incorporate version #'s via #define
             and also modify Info.plist and _private.res inclusion on
             OS X and Win32.

2007.04.01 - Added Reset button

           - messing around with the VIA timing in hopes of fixing the
             extra-fast clock.  Helps, but still a bit too fast.

           - fixing OS X issues

           - switching skins is really broken on OS X, so switched it
             to will be done next time you run LisaEm.  This sucks,
             but it sucks less than having a broken display.

           - Printing on OS X works, but sometimes locks up LisaEm
             on shutdown.

           - windows now save their positions and restore on next boot

2007.03.30 - more printer work

           - timing correction: catch up on lost cycles if cpu<clock

2007.03.28 - some light via work - attempting to fix any discrepancies
             between via1/via2 (cops.c also contains via1_[i|o]ra().

2007.03.27 - printer work: changed printer wire plots to be rounder.
             got rid of horizontal gaps, but it turns out
             that there are protocol errors which cause two
             more bugs: pages are pre-maturely FF'ed, and
             horizontal data lines are lost on some lines.

2007.03.26 - with skins off, blacken whole screen instead to prevent artifacts
             except for OS X.

           - added option to completely hide the host mouse cursor.  It 
             surprisingly works better than I expected.

           - added Flush Printers menu item to force printouts to end
             once they're done.  Should also speed up shutdown since this
             happens there too.

2007.03.24 - James Savage of the Retro Mac Cast found these two bugs:

           - saving PNG screenshots are always grayscale.  Should be
             color for full screenshots.

           - power button on skin is triggered by just moving the
             mouse over the power button.  Fixed so click is required.

           - fixed some issues with switching between skins on/off.

2007.03.20 - pauses reported by Kallikak fixed, throttle mechanism rewritten

           - printing: added scale as some printerDC's are 600dpi and we
             work at 300dpi.

2007.03.18 - printing: fixing half page issues

           - fixed memory clobbering bug in printing code - caused profile
             corruption on linux since dc42's are mmap'ed, would have caused
             random issues elsewhere.

2007.03.17 - printing: fixed png background color issue

           - printing: pages were halved vertically, fixing this now but
             not quite right yet, only half a page makes it out
             now but it is the correct aspect ratio. 

2007.03.16 - added Refresh Rate to display menu: 60,20,12Hz. (Needs to be
             in odd multiplier of refresh rate, otherwise cursor in text
             fields will stop flashing)

           - Printing: tweaking color table in BMP generation as PNG's show 
             up with a gray background. (BMP's show up properly.)

2007.03.15 - fixed mouse/skin issues.

           - fixed some serial port issues, but still crashes emulator.   

2007.03.14 - skins initialization issues with skins on. caused mouse issues
             on startup.

           - skinless size increased as edges were getting cut off.

           - some z8530 fixes, but still does not properly work, causes LisaEm
             to quit.

2007.03.13 - found a fixed config bug: serial b options copied from port a.

           - added a switch to turn off power to the virtual Profile before
             power on.  This allows you to prevent the boot ROM's Power on
             self test to automatically boot from the Profile.  It's useful
             when you need to repair the Profile since it allows you to
             boot from "Lisa Office System 1/5" and then power on the
             Profile drive to repair the file system.

2007.03.11 - Proper BMP's are now generated for printing, conversion to PNG
             format works, but is a little bit off - background is gray,
             should be white as in paper white.

           - added command line ability to load preferences file when
             launching. i.e. ./lisaem ~ray/macworks.lisaem will open the
             macworks.lisaem preferences file from user ray's home.

2007.03.10 - getting closer on proper BMP generation for printing

           - added throttle setting to global preferences.

           - added ROM checksum failure warning on power on.  If the ROM is 
             broken, it can crash the emulator.

2007.03.09 - skins on/off added to Display menu.

           - found IW linefeed pixel bug (lack of initialization)

2007.03.08 - video modes are a bit smarter - if display size is too small, 
             will refuse to change video modes and will instead switch to 
             lower mode, or shut off skins.

           - re-enaled 2Y and 2X3Y video modes (skinless of course.) with 
             checks for display size.

           - skin/less mode switch no longer requires restart of emulator.  
             Extra space past display region is blackened to ameliorate window
             sizing bugs.

           - Preferences "Apply" button (was save in preview versions) closes
             Preferences window.

2007.03.06 - added skinless option (bug: size of window is too small/off). One 
             blit less during skinless mode so it's a bit faster on older 
             machines.

           - NMI key can be forced now.

2007.03.02 - Video mode, sound effects, asciikeyboard as globally saved prefs.

           - added Sound Effects checkbox.

           - debugging printing - somehow all pages show up black.

2007.03.01 - added NMI key to keyboard menu.

2007.02.28 - new IW code printouts sort of works.

2007.02.21 - Added Preferences panel for printer settings.

2007.02.20 - added size dialog box when creating profile (5/10MB, etc)

2007.02.18 - unified build.sh - because automake/autoconf sucks noodles

2007.02.05 - I/O ROM version was getting clobbered by code in floppy.c to 
             0xA8 via a #define.

2007.02.03 - cheat_ram_test now a preference.

           - if starting without ROM, dialogbox is shown, then preferences are
             shown asking for config.

           - bug fix: after closing preferences, re-opening caused segfault.

           - finer speed control - much closer.

2007.02.02 - fixed floppy insert on power off

           - fixed floppy trapping on insert of non-DC42/bad disk image.

           - fixed "Clock is not set" dialog box

           - fixed ContrastTrails (linx/win32)

2007.02.01 - fixed raw kb entry - but CPU clock is still too fast.

2007.01.31 - fixed bug causing random crashes, mostly during LOS install.  Was
             off-by-one array overflow related to ReDraw_* fn's.

--- Preview Release 2007/01/28

2007.01.28   Fixes:
             - Fixes to libdc42 for profile access. Should be able to read and write to
               ProFile images to install Lisa Office System on a new disc.

             - Split ROM images are now supported - it will automatically merge them and
               save as *.ROM

             - Double-clicking on the mouse is now recognised in Lisa OS. This fix is a
               hack, and will need to be fixed properly in the future.

             - When quitting LisaEm on Mac OS X, the Preview Release used to crash. This
               has been fixed.

             - Crash on Restart from Lisa Office System Installer fixed.
             - Missing horizontal scrollbar on OS X seems to be fixed, but not sure why or
               how.

             - The duration of the click sound during the Lisa ROM tests was far too long,
               it now clicks rather than beeping.

             Known bugs:

             - Floppy animation does not work on OS X due to double buffering.

             - Floppy motor sounds and some other sounds do not work on OS X

             - Some light gray screen artifacts in the Windows build.

             - Still no documentation at all.

2007.01.24   Preview Release
             - No change notes, first release.
